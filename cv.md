## Teaching and Tutoring

### Internship Tutor

*Andrea B. and Mattia A.* in FBK, Security and Trust Unit $\bullet$ *Jun, 2022 - Present*

<p style="text-align: justify;"><small>Andrea B. and Mattia A. are two outstanding students from Istituto Tecnico Tecnologico Buonarroti (Trento, Italy). They readily comprehended complicated topics like as databases and overflow threats despite just being in their third year. They are working with me and my colleague Salvatore Manfredi on a project that will raise awareness about security postures (e.g. password management, phishing awareness and more).</small></p>

---

*Federico C.* in FBK, Security and Trust Unit $\bullet$ *Feb, 2022 - Apr, 2022*

<p style="text-align: justify;"><small>I had the opportunity to oversee Federico C., an undergraduate student at University of Trento, thanks to my colleague Salvatore Manfredi. Federico did an excellent job by collecting information on overall webserver use and, more specifically, Public Administration in Italy. Upon learning that NGINX was competing with APACHE, he included several mitigations into NGINX and developed a parser for TLSAssistant. </small></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><small>The parser can quickly scan an NGINX configuration and automatically repair any TLS vulnerabilities discovered. Federico was finally able to analyze the TLS environment in deep and correct additional flaws he discovered in the tool.</small></p>

----

*Ivan V.* in FBK, Security and Trust Unit $\bullet$ *Feb, 2022 - Apr, 2022*

<p style="text-align: justify;"><small>Thanks to my colleague Salvatore Manfredi, I have overseen the internship of an undergraduate student at University of Trento, Ivan V. . Ivan, a talented student, researched the TLS area to see what new threats had emerged. Ivan encountered ALPACA, Racoon, Zombie POODLE, Golden DOODLE, 0-Length OpenSSL, and Sleeping POODLE after researching the literature. Using POODLE variations as a starting point, Ivan investigated the optimal method for integrating these vulnerability checks into TLSAssistant. Ivan progressively included all prior vulnerability assessments (i.e. ALPACA, POODLE variants and Racoon). Not only did he incorporate them into our tool, but he also corrected and made the external tool TLSScanner more efficient by statistically demonstrating it by scanning the Alexa top 50,000 websites.</small></p>



## Public Events

## Technical and Programming Skills

<p style="text-align: justify;"> I am widely proficient in everything that touches the cybersecurity realm. My areas of expertise include security testing, vulnerability assessment, cyberrisk assessment, network security (e.g. DmZ, firewalls, honeypots), privacy, trust, OSINT, and digital identity. During the Machine Learning course, I worked with advanced deep learning systems (such as a convolutional neural network to identify Covid-19 from radiography, in 2020), achieved the highest gpa in multimedia data security (e.g. invisible and visible watermarking, compression resistant watermarking and classifying differences from video compression applied by Facebook and Youtube). I also earned the highest GPA in the Offensive Technologies course, in which I learned how to perform attack and defense in the cyberspace.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout my career, I have discovered numerous flaws ‚Äîsome of them critical‚Äî in the infrastructures used by the Fondazione Bruno Kessler. I was also able to collaborate with the Postal Police while researching new technologies in the field. In addition, I managed to analyze the CIEApp (Carta Identit√† Elettronica) with the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). Threat intelligence is a topic that deeply interests me.</p>
